<div><h2>The Where & Why</h2></div>
<p>
Well, it first started with us painting for as long as we could remember. Fiddling with paitn brushes,
and making a mess while creating a masterpiece is the foundation for our creativity not only wiht paintings,
but our frames and the expereince of purchasing one. We take pride in those in the art culture supplying the community
with paintings from the 15th century. Our journey on searching for quality materials has led us to improve the expereince 
of purchasing a painting. A feeling you could never forget.
</p>
<div><h2>Why So Much Tho?</h2></div>
<p>
We ensure the frames & paintings come from the finest materieals and care throughout our process.
Each painting shall be hand signed by its artist, along with a personalized handwritten note to our valued customers.
We offer personalization to each frame ones chooses. We encourage all shopers to "go all out" and flex on all the h8ers,
who don't understand the meaning behind the picture, the frame, and the way it sits on the wall. We understand a good expereince
is a lifetime customer.</p>
